# Specs

Specs are structured documents for planning and implementing features.

## Structure
Each spec lives in its own folder under `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/`:
- `requirements.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Technical design and architecture
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist

## How to Create a Spec
1. Ask Kiro to create a spec for your feature
2. Review and approve requirements
3. Review and approve design
4. Execute tasks from the task list

## Existing Specs
(None yet - ask Kiro to create one!)
